## Tempus Valorem: A Strategy Game

A fun and interesting game about how you spend your life.
This project is sponsored by the [GotChoices Foundation](https://gotchoices.org)
and is part of the [MyCHIPs](https://mychips.org) initiative.

When learning about alternative payment systems, it is important to understand value.
Value is a subjective notion that can be difficult to process.

Tempus Valorem helps demonstrate what we value and how we choose to spend our time.
It can help understand how to implement a digital payment system
(medium of exchange) that holds a consistent value and functions most effectively in trade.

### Project Status
An [early attempt](https://github.com/gotchoices/tempus) was made some years 
ago to implement a similar game using vue.js.  That project was never completed.
We are trying again--this time using Colyseus and Phaser.

We will attempt to get a functional, prototype game model up and running in time
for demonstration at the 2023 
[Collaborative Credit Conference](https://gqcca.notion.site/Collaborative-Finance-General-Information-page-7bd804923d9340729c9b9fd232b2a5f1)
in Reichenau Austria.

If it proves useful there, we will consider improving it and making it generally
available for educational purposes at [Tempus Valorem](tempusvalorem.net).
